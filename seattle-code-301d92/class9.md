## Readings: Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1.What is functional programming?--*A style of programming that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands.*

2.What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?--*A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.*

3.What are the benefits of a pure function?--*Pure Functions are small, precise, simple, safe and straightforward to reuse. A pure function guarantees that they will not modify anything outside their body. *

4.What is immutability?--*An immutable value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value.*

5.What is Referential transparency?--*Referential Transparency emphasizes that an expression in a JavaScript program may be replaced by its value or any other variable having the same value without changing the result of the program.*

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1.What is a module?--*Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application.*

2.What does the word ‘require’ do?--*In NodeJS, require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files.*

3.How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?--*To include functions defined in another file in Node. js, we need to import the module. We will use the require keyword at the top of the file. The result of require is then stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation*

4.What do we have to do to make a module available?--*Creating Node. js modules create a package.json file, Create the file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application, Test your module, and Resources.*
