## Class 5 Reading Notes

## My reading journal for seattle-code-301d92

## Readings: Putting it all together - React Docs - Thinking in React

1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?--*Every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program.*

2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?--*? Allows React to get the values of propTypes and defaultProps , without initializing your component.*

3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?--*Use your existing React repository, or fork our sample React repo on GitHub or GitLab,
Create a new Static Site on Render, and give Render permission to access your new repo, and build command publish direcitorybuild.*

4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?--*Is it passed in from a parent via props?, Does it remain unchanged over time?, and can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?*

5. How can you identify where state needs to live?--*? The state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. *

## Higher-Order Functions

1. What is a “higher-order function”?--*In React for reusing component logic a function that takes a component and returns a new compnent.*

2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?--*Higher Orders Functions are functions that perform operations on other functions.  greaterThan(10) calling number greater than 10 to render like 11?*

3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.--*?*

## Things I want to know more about.....
