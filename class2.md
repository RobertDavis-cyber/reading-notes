# Class 2 Reading Notes Choosing A Text Editor

Here are my notes

# Different classifications of text editors

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files.

1. Every computer has its own text editor. On Mac computers is called, “Text Edit.” 

2. On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
   your computer is called, “Notepad.”
   
 # third-party options? Let’s talk about software
 
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites.

# What is IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

# Why it’s important for software developers?

Text editors (and IDEs) are probably the most important tools when it comes to software engineering. They help to improve your productivity, and they can make your job easier by implementing text predictions, plugins, git integrations and so on.
