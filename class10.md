Reading 10 Debugging

# Why this topic matters studying in this module.

*It is useful allows us software engineers and developers to fix errors in a program before releasing it to the public.

# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

-1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

*A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language. A logical error is an error in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly but not to terminate abnormally.

-2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

*I left off a closing brace (}) which I do a lot getting used to the process coding is new to me.  Fixed it by making sure to use closing brace and use Replit as a tool and checked the console.

-3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

*The debugging reading I found very interesting because it explains a lot about bugs and errors.  Long term goals I feel like we will have to be checking for errors on a regular basis.  Seeing our instructor in the demo class lecture was a great example of what is needed to debugging when things are not working correcly.

# The JavaScript Debugger.

-1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

*Javascript debugger tool is used to find out coding errors in the program. While we are writing some new programming code, there may be a chance to encounter some errors. These errors may be syntactical or logical.

-2. Define what a breakpoint is.

*In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

-3. What is the call stack?
*A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

# Things I want to know more about?

It would be great to see or get more informations on real world situations about debugging and who it works. I like to see visuals and examples of work situations.
