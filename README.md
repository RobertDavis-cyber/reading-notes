*Growth Mindset* in **believe in your ability to become better by working harder, and asking for help from those around you**

3 Reminders to Myself to Stay in Growth Mindset:
- Choose to learn well over learning fast.
- Take feedback and cristicism with an open mind - use it to motivate you to learn.
- Mistaks are important part of the process to grow.

*Markdown Basic Syntax*

# Headings:
-To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

# Styling text:
-You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Style	Syntax	Keyboard shortcut	Example	Output
Bold	** ** or __ __	Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux)	**This is bold text**	This is bold text
Italic	* * or _ _     	Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux)	*This text is italicized*	This text is italicized
Strikethrough	~~ ~~		~~This was mistaken text~~	This was mistaken text
Bold and nested italic	** ** and _ _		**This text is _extremely_ important**	This text is extremely important
All bold and italic	*** ***		***All this text is important***	All this text is important
Subscript	<sub> </sub>		<sub>This is a subscript text</sub>	This is a subscript text
Superscript	<sup> </sup>		<sup>This is a superscript text</sup>	This is a superscript text

# Quoting text
-You can quote text with a >.

# Quoting code
-You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

# Supported color models
-You can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

-Here are the currently supported color models.

Color	Syntax	Example	Output
HEX	`#RRGGBB`	`#0969DA`	Rendered supported color model in HEX format.
RGB	`rgb(R,G,B)`	`rgb(9, 105, 218)`	Rendered supported color model in RGB format.
HSL	`hsl(H,S,L)`	`hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`	Rendered supported color model in HSL format.

# Links
-You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

# Section links
-You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading.

# Relative links
-A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Images
-You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

# Specifying the theme an image
-You can specify the theme an image is displayed for in Markdown by using the HTML <picture> element in combination with the prefers-color-scheme media feature.
  
- Example, the following code displays a sun image for light themes and a moon for dark themes:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456776-7f95b81a-f1ed-45f7-b7ab-8fa810d529fa.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
  <img alt="Shows an illustrated sun in light color mode and a moon with stars in dark color mode." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
