# Class 2 Reading Notes Choosing A Text Editor

Here are my notes

# Different classifications of text editors

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files.

1. Every computer has its own text editor. On Mac computers is called, “Text Edit.” 

2. On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
   your computer is called, “Notepad.”
   
 # third-party options? Let’s talk about software
 
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites.

# What is IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

# Why it’s important for software developers?

Text editors (and IDEs) are probably the most important tools when it comes to software engineering. They help to improve your productivity, and they can make your job easier by implementing text predictions, plugins, git integrations and so on.

# Notes introduction to using a terminal. 

# 1. The Command Line

Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.

If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .


# 2. Basic Navigation

# pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
# ls
List the contents of a directory.
# cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

Relative path
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

# 3 About Files

# file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
# ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.
Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
