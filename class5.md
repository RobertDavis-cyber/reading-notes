# CSS syntax

CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}

-1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

The foreground controls what color your brush or pencil will be, while the background color erases any added color and replaces it with the background color, which is white by default.

-2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

The background color of your website plays an important role in your design and branding, and in making your content more readable.
 
 Add p {color: #000080; } to the head section of your HTML file.

-3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

Branding, Legibility.

-4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

The size attribute specifies how large a font will be displayed in either relative or absolute terms. Close the <font> tag with </font> to return to a normal text size. The default font size is 3, and the largest font size that can be displayed in a browser is 7.

The font-weight property is used in CSS and certain HTML elements. It is used to specify the weight or boldness of the text, or font.

The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text. This property has three values: normal - The text is shown normally. italic - The text is shown in italics.

-5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

You can insert blank spaces in text in HTML, type &nbsp; for each space to add

You can use pixel values. letter-spacing: 0.1em; You can use em values: this allows the spacing to remain relative to the font-size.
