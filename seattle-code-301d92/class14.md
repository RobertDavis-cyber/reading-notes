## Class 14 Reading Notes My Reading Journal for seattle-code-301d92

## Readings:  Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1.What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?--*Women were pushed away from programming by both male-centric stereotypes in ads and movies, and by publications of computers being wasteful.*

2.Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?--*Computers entered the category of "boys' toys." Having access to and familiarity with these machines gave boys a leg up in entry-level programing classes. Women in these classes were learning programming for the first time, while men were honing skills they had been developing for years.*

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1.When are diversity efforts most successful?--*Build upon previous plans, integrate diversity into general planning and operations,
make diversity, equity.*

2.Why do diverse companies perform better?--*Making diversity an integral part of the hiring process, your organization can gain access to a much larger talent pool. This increases the probability of hiring the best people and builds high-performance teams with a more effective set of skills and knowledge*

3.Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.--*Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare provider, is unique among many corporations in that 60% of its staff are people of color. What's more, 75% of employees, and half of the executive team, are female.*
