## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	                  NoSQL
1.SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
2.SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
3.SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
4.SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
5.SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

1.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?--*SQL databases are perfectly suited for storing and processing structured data, while NoSQL databases are the best solution for working with unstructured or semi-structured data.*

2.Give a real world example.--*SQL is used in everyday life by some of the biggest companies like Netflix, Linkedin, Amazon, Flipkart, Instagram. Uber for data analysis and performance analysis. Even small companies and startups employ SQL for similar purposes. SQL is a great tool for interacting with databases and fetching vital data.*

3.What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?--*NoSQL databases are built to be flexible, scalable, and capable of rapidly responding to the data management demands of modern businesses. Document databases, Key-value stores, and Graph databases/*

4.Give a real world example.--*Marriott deploys NoSQL for its reservation system that books $38 billion annually.*

5.Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?--*Use the hierarchyid functions in Transact-SQL to query and manage hierarchical data.*

6.Which type of database is best for scalability?--*EDB for PostgreSQL (Horizontal Scaling),CitusData (Distributed SQL),ScaleGrid (Horizontal Scaling),Aiven for PostgreSQL (Multi-Cloud),Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.,Azure PostgreSQL Database., and Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.*

## sql vs nosql (Video)

1.What does SQL stand for?--*stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database*

2.What is a relational database?--*A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how different data structures relate to each other.*

3.What type of structure does a relational database work with?--*An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure which connects related data elements. An RDBMS includes functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data. *

4.What is a ‘schema’?--*schema is a list of logical structures of data. A database user owns the schema, which has the same name as the database manager.*

5.What is a NoSQL database?--*are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.*

6.How does it work?--*oSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as “not only SQL” and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.*

7.What is inside of a MongoDB database?--*
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database management system (DBMS). Unlike traditional relational DBMSs, which store data in tables consisting of rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like structures referred to as documents.*

8.Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.--*While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.*

9.What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?--*One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.*
