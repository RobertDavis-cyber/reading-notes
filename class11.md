 Grid Laytout the CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
  
 Grid item a grid container contains grid items.
  
 Grid line using grid lines allows us to explicitly state an item's location on two dimensions - both for columns and for rows. This is why CSS Grid is known as a two-dimensional layout system. This is one of the primary distinctions between CSS Grid and Flexbox.

By default, a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.

The `srcset` and `sizes` attributes on `img` (or `source`) elements allow authors to define various image resources.

A <picture> element with two source files, and a fallback image:

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width:650px)" srcset="img_pink_flowers.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width:465px)" srcset="img_white_flower.jpg">
  <img src="img_orange_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;">
