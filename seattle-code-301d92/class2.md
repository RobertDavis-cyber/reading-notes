# React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’? *Rendering?   This is the order when DOM in the mounting phase.  Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React? 

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

4. What does componentDidMount do?

# React State Vs Props

1.What types of things can you pass in the props? *Props sort of remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them example objects, arrays, and functions.

2. What is the big difference between props and state? *State is internal and controlled by the component itself. Props are external and controlled by what renders the component.
 
3. When do we re-render our application? *Re-render happens when React needs to update the app with some new data. Example when a user interacting with the app or some external data coming through.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state? *e-commerce site information like the ordered product, quantity, delivery person, delivery fee, total amount, and etc can be stored in logical state.
