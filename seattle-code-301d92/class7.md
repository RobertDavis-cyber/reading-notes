## Readings: Readings: REST

## How I explained REST to my brother.

1. Who is Roy Fielding?--*Some super smart guy who helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet.*

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?--*Computers can use these same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.  Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.*

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?--*HTTP he helped write, HTTP, the first part that tells the browser what protocol to use.   The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.*

4. What does a GET do?--*A GET request, is a way for you to grab data from a data source with the help of the internet.*

5. What does a POST do?--*POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body.*

6. What does PUT do?--*PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.*

7. What does PATCH do?--*PATCH request for making partial changes to an existing resource.*

## Things I want to know more about...

Where is the best place to store your API keys?  Can API keys be shared with team members when you are working on projects?  Does each person need to have a seperate API key?
